## Real estate in new york
```{r}
library("Stat2Data")
data("HousesNY")
```


```{r}
typeof(HousesNY)
```

## Dataset preparation
```{r}
houses_price_NY = as.matrix(HousesNY)
houses_price_NY[1:10,]
```

```{r}
class(houses_price_NY)
```
##### Rename in french
```{r}
colnames(houses_price_NY) = c("Prix", "Chambres", "Salle_de_bain", "Taille", "Terrain")
houses_price_NY[1:10,]
```

##### Convert size to  m2
```{r}
acre_size = houses_price_NY[,"Salle_de_bain"]
acre_size
```
```{r}
m2_size = acre_size * 4046.86
m2_size
```
## Matrix operation
```{r}
mean(houses_price_NY[,"Prix"]) #The average house price
```
```{r}
summary(houses_price_NY)
```
```{r}
min(houses_price_NY[,1]) #The cheapest house price
```
```{r}
houses_price_NY[houses_price_NY[,1]==min(houses_price_NY[,1]),] #characteristics of this house
```
```{r}
max(houses_price_NY[,1]) #he most expensive house
```
```{r}
houses_price_NY[houses_price_NY[,1]==197.5,] #characteristics of this house
```

```{r}
houses_price_NY[houses_price_NY[,1]<100,]
```





```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Construction de vecteurs
1. Create the vector v equal to (101 ; 102 ;... ; 112).
```{r}
v= c(101:112)
v
```
2. Create the vector w of length 12 formed by four times the sequence of numbers (4 ; 6 ; 3).
```{r}
w = rep(c(4,6,3), 4)
w
```
3. Create the vector x consisting of eight times the number 4, seven times the number 6 and five times the number 3.
```{r}
x = rep(c(4, 6, 3), c(8, 7, 5))
x
```

## More vectors
1. Enter the weight variable containing the following 15 values : 28 ; 27, 5 ; 27 ; 28 ; 30, 5 ; 30 ; 31 ; 29, 5 ; 30 ; 31 ; 31 ; 31, 5 ; 32 ; 30 ; 30, 5.
```{r}
weight = c(28, 27.5, 27, 28, 30.5, 30, 31, 29.5, 30, 31, 31, 31.5, 32, 30, 30.5)
weight
```
2. Enter the variable weight1 containing the following 5 values : 40 ; 39 ; 41 ; 37, 5 ; 43.
```{r}
weight1 = c(40, 39, 41, 37.5, 43.)
weight1
```
3. Without redoing any entry, create the variable new.weight containing 20 values : - the five values of weight1 repeated twice - and the last ten values of weight.
```{r}
new.weight = c(rep(weight1, 2), weight[5:15])
new.weight
```

4. Save, in your working directory, the new.weight variable in a sheet named
”New Weight” of the Excel workbook ”Weight.xls”.
```{r}
write.
```




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
